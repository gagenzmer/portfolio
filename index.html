        <h1>Hello. I'm Gage</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio. I'm excited to share my passion for coding and design, please have a look around!</p>
        <p>I got into design because I've always been drawn to the way things look and the joy of bringing something to life. It offers a window for others to see from my perspective.</p>
